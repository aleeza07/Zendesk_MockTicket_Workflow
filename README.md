🚀 Daily Progress Update: Zendesk CRM Mock Tickets (50+ Tickets Handled!)
Today, I worked on another 10 mock tickets 🎫 for my company, Roco Private Limited 🏢. With this, I’ve now successfully handled 50+ tickets in Zendesk CRM! 🎉

🔹 Key Tasks & Learnings:

-Acted as a Zendesk Agent 🤵, assisting mock customers with different ticket types: Incidents ⚠️, Questions ❓, and Tasks ✔️.

-Ensured all responses were provided within SLA limits ⏳, simulating real-world support scenarios.

-Gained hands-on experience in navigating the Zendesk workspace 🖥️, making the platform feel intuitive.

📊 Workflow Tracking & Analysis:

*Maintained a detailed Excel sheet 📑 logging:

-Issue, Ticket Type, Priority, Mode of Communication (Email/Chat/Call), Category

-Invoice Date/Time, Response Date/Time, SLA Compliance

*Created a Pivot Table 📈 to analyze:

-Ticket distribution by Category

-Count of tickets per communication mode

-Trends in ticket resolution

🌟 Overall Experience:
This was an incredibly insightful exercise! 🎯 By setting up my own company (Roco Private Ltd.) and generating mock tickets, I got realistic exposure to Zendesk’s workflow. Tracking everything in Excel added a layer of data-driven analysis 📊, helping me understand support metrics better.

Excited to keep refining my skills! 🚀
